## 🏆 **The "Impossible" Automations**

### 🛡️ **Bypass Cloudflare Like a Ghost**
```
Use stealth-browser to navigate to a Cloudflare-protected site that blocks all bots. Take a screenshot proving you're accessing the content. Then extract the main content area using extract_complete_element_cdp and show me the HTML structure.
```
*💡 Why this goes viral: Everyone struggles with Cloudflare. This just works.*

### 🏦 **Automate Banking Without Getting Flagged**  
```
Use stealth-browser to navigate to [your bank's] login page. Take a screenshot of the login form. Use extract_element_structure to analyze the form fields and security measures. Report what anti-bot protections are visible and how they differ from regular forms.
```
*💡 Why this goes viral: Banks block everyone. This doesn't get detected.*

### 🎯 **Clone Any UI Element Perfectly**
```
Use stealth-browser to navigate to stripe.com/pricing. Use extract_complete_element_cdp to clone their pricing table with pixel-perfect accuracy. Extract all CSS, fonts, images, and animations. Generate working HTML that I can use in my own site.
```

## 🚀 **Advanced AI Workflows**

### 🕵️ **Turn AI Agent Into Network Detective**
```
Use stealth-browser to navigate to [modern web app]. As I interact with the page, use list_network_requests to monitor all API calls in real-time. For each request, use get_request_details and get_response_content to show me exactly what data is being sent and received. Create a complete API map with endpoints, authentication methods, rate limits, and data schemas.
```
*💡 Why this goes viral: Replaces expensive API analysis tools with simple AI chat*

### 🎯 **AI Writes Custom Network Hooks**
```
Use stealth-browser's dynamic hook system to create custom Python functions that intercept and modify network requests in real-time. Create a hook that blocks all social media trackers during work hours, redirects API calls to mock servers for testing, and logs authentication requests with custom headers. Show me the Python code the AI generated.
```
*💡 Why this goes viral: No other tool lets AI write custom interception logic*

### 🤖 **Execute Python Code Inside Chrome**
```
Use stealth-browser to navigate to a page with a complex form. Use execute_python_in_browser to write Python code that analyzes the page structure, fills out the form intelligently, and validates the data before submission. Show me the Python code running inside the browser.
```

### 🎭 **Multi-Tab Social Media Operations**  
```
Use stealth-browser to open 5 tabs: LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok. In each tab, navigate to a competitor's profile and use progressive element cloning to extract their content strategy. Use expand_styles and expand_events to understand their engagement mechanics. Compile a comprehensive competitive analysis.
```

```

### 🎫 **Event Ticket Monitoring System**
```
Use stealth-browser to monitor Ticketmaster for [artist/event]. Use wait_for_element to detect when tickets become available, then use extract_element_assets to capture seat maps and pricing. Use network interception to understand their inventory system.
```

### 🏠 **Real Estate Data Pipeline**  
```
Use stealth-browser to create a real estate monitoring system across Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com. Use progressive element cloning to extract property details, then use execute_python_in_browser to analyze market trends and identify undervalued properties in real-time.
